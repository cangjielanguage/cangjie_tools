# Cangjie Language Command Line Tools

## Introduction

The Cangjie language provides a rich set of command line tools for developers. After successfully installing the Cangjie toolchain, you can use these tools according to the manual instructions.

## Open Source Project Introduction

The current Cangjie tools include:

- Cangjie Package Manager `cjpm`
- Cangjie Formatter `cjfmt`
- Cangjie Linter `cjlint`
- Cangjie Coverage `cjcov`
- Cangjie HyperLang Extension `hle`
- Cangjie Languager Server `lsp`
- Cangjie Trace Recover `cjtrace-recover`

Please refer to the following software architecture diagrams for the command-line tools and language server tools:
